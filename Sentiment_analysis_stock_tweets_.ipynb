The first parameter is the max_features parameter, which is set to 1500. This is because when you convert words to numbers using the bag of words approach, all the unique words in all the documents are converted into features. All the documents can contain tens of thousands of unique words. But the words that have a very low frequency of occurrence are unusually not a good parameter for classifying documents. Therefore we set the max_features parameter to 1500, which means that we want to use 1500 most occurring words as features for training our classifier.\n",

        "The next parameter is min_df and it has been set to 5. This corresponds to the minimum number of documents that should contain this feature. So we only include those words that occur in at least 5 documents. Similarly, for the max_df, feature the value is set to 0.7; in which the fraction corresponds to a percentage. Here 0.7 means that we should include only those words that occur in a maximum of 70% of all the documents. Words that occur in almost every document are usually not suitable for classification because they do not provide any unique information about the document.\n",
